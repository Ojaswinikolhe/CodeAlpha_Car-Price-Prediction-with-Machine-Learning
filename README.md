# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning 🚗📊

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the selling price of a car based on its features.

## 📌 Objective
To build a regression model that predicts car prices using:
- Mileage
- Age of car
- Fuel type
- Transmission
- Present (original) price
- Owner type

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset Columns
- Car_Name  
- Year  
- Selling_Price (Target)  
- Present_Price  
- Driven_kms  
- Fuel_Type  
- Selling_type  
- Transmission  
- Owner  

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Removed unnecessary spaces
- Label encoded categorical columns
- Added new feature: Car Age

  
## 🧮 Model Evaluation
Metrics:
- R2 Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
